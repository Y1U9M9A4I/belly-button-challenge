# Module 14 Challenge : Interactive Visualizations

In this assignment, I will be building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. This dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Visualizations #

Two interactive visualizations are in this page: 

1. Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found (Horizontal Bar Graph)
2. Bacteria Cultures per specific samples relating Number of Bacteria vs. OTU ID (Bubble Plot)

# Deployment #

This app is deployed through free static page hosting service, Github Pages. Please see this link located through Settings -> Pages (at the top of the page), or at the following link directly:
